  <p>Dear Local Office,</p>
  <p id="doctorName">Doctor <span th:text="${not #strings.isEmpty(givenName)} ? |${givenName}| : _"></span
  > <span th:text="${not #strings.isEmpty(familyName)} ? |${familyName}| : _">(family name missing)</span
  > GMC number <span th:text="${not #strings.isEmpty(gmcNumber)} ? |${gmcNumber}| : _">(GMC number missing)</span
  ></p>
  <p>The recent update to GMC details was rejected by TIS, and the GMC number has been reset to that shown above. <a id="tisTraineeLink"
      th:href="${'https://apps.tis.nhs.uk/admin/people/person/' + {traineeId} + '/edit-personal-details'}">Review</a> their details to confirm.</p>
  <p>This may be caused by a variety of factors. For example, duplicate GMC numbers are not allowed. Please review the TIS profile and/or liaise with the doctor as required.</p>
  <p>Kind Regards,</p>
  <p>TIS Self-Service</p>
