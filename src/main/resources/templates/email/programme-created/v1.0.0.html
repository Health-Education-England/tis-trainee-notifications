  <p>Congratulations on your appointment to the <b><span
      th:text="${not #strings.isEmpty(programmeName)} ? ${programmeName} : 'programme'"></span></b>.</p>
  <p>Please take some time to read this email in its entirety. It contains vital information to help you start the onboarding processes for your training programme and there are some actions that you will need to do straight away.</p>
  <p><b>Please note:</b></p>
  <p><ul>
  <li>We are in process of ensuring your Training Programme Director(s) (TPDs) have your details.</li>
  <li>also be aware NHS England is not your employer, we act on behalf of your Postgraduate Dean and manage your training programme for the duration of your training.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p><b>Timeline:</b></p>
  <p>Over the next couple of months, you will receive a series of automated messages from NHS England via TSS (TIS Self Service) and email communications from colleagues within <span th:text="${not #strings.isEmpty(localOfficeName)} ? ${localOfficeName} : 'your local deanery office"></span
  >, with some vital pieces of information.</p>
  <p><b>Placement Confirmation</b></p>
  <p>At 12 weeks prior to your commencement in post, you will receive a placement notification from us. Please note this does not constitute an offer of employment but is a confirmation of the placement you will be due to undertake and mirrors the information that has been provided to your employing organisation.</p>
  <p>At this point, your employing organisation will follow the NHS Employment Check Standards, details of which can be found <a href="https://www.nhsemployers.org/topics-0/employment-standards-and-regulation">here</a>.</p>
  <p><b>National Training Number (NTN)</b></p>
  <p>Subject to you completing all actions on TIS Self Service, on the first day <span
    th:text="${not #strings.isEmpty(startDate)} ? ${startDate} : _"></span> of your programme, you will receive your National Training Number (NTN). It is also vitally important you connect to your Postgraduate Dean for Revalidation and ensure you are connected to the correct Deanery as your Designated Body on GMC Online. Please do <b>not</b> do this before <span
    th:text="${not #strings.isEmpty(startDate)} ? ${startDate} : _"></span>. It is essential you do not connect to your trust or employing body. The notice containing your NTN will explain how to do this.</p>
  <p><b>Pre-employment checks and processes</b></p>
  <p>Both NHS England and your employing organisation understand that you will be busy in this transition period to the start of your upcoming training programme, but we wish to emphasise the importance of engaging with all organisations with the onboarding process.</p>
  <p>Your employing organisation will be contacting you about pre-employment checks from 12 weeks prior to starting. It is essential you avoid delaying these processes so as not to cause any disruption to your employment or training programme. <b>The Medical Staffing teams will be processing a large number of new starters to their organisation and so any delay may impact their ability to add you to their employment systems, such as payroll.</b></p>
  <p>Please ensure you contact your employing organisation if you have not heard anything <b>8 weeks</b> prior to your start date. Details about who this will be, will be contained in the placement confirmation email that you will receive 12 weeks before starting.</p>
  <p>This timescale is in line with the <a href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/medical-recruitment/code-practice-medical-recruitment">code of practice</a> agreed in conjunction with the BMA and NHS Employers.</p>
  <p>Their pre-employment checks will include:</p><ul>
  <li>Your right to work</li>
  <li>If you have a criminal record</li>
  <li>Employment history and references</li>
  <li>Professional Registration and qualifications</li>
  <li>Fitness to work</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b><u>ACTIONs</u></b></p>
  <p><b>TIS Self-Service (TSS)</b></p>
