        Training placements may be subject to change due to educational needs and service requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your offer of appointment is subject to satisfactory pre‚Äêemployment checks.
        It is essential that Occupational Health screening, Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS)
        and other pre-employment checks take place prior to your arrival.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if you are in an NHS trust currently, if you are moving employer,
        you will still need to complete your pre-employment checks before you move to your next placement.
        Failure to complete pre-employment checks in a timely manner can cause delays to your pay,
        training, I.T and facilities access which will impact your training experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your Trust will follow the
        <a
          href="https://www.nhsemployers.org/topics-0/employment-standards-and-regulation"
          th:target="_blank"
        >NHS Employment Check Standards</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their checks will include:
        <ul>
          <li>Your right to work</li>
          <li>If you have a criminal record</li>
          <li>Employment history and references</li>

        The notification to trusts and doctors in training at 12 weeks is in line with the
        <a
          href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/medical-recruitment/code-practice-medical-recruitment"
          th:target="_blank"
        >code of practice</a>
        (CoP) agreed in conjunction with the BMA and NHS Employers.
        In some cases, such as when there is delayed allocation to a post due to unexpected circumstances,
        the trust will work to a shortened timeline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the CoP agreement, you are responsible for providing information when requested,
        keeping your employer fully informed of any changes to your contact details and start date.
        Failure to do so may impact on your pay or terms and conditions and your ability to take up your training post.
        Please note changes to placements now finalised will only be agreed in very exceptional circumstances.
